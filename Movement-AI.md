One of the most fundamental requirements of artificial intelligence is to move characters around in the game sensibly.

Some games rely mainly on movement algorithms and don't have any more advanced decision making. On the other hand, some games don't need moving characters at all. Resource management games and turn-based games often don't need movement algorithms; once a decision is made where to move, the character can simply be placed there.

In the following section we'll look at the following topics:
- [[Steering Behaviors]] used for driving a racing car or piloting a spaceship in two or three dimensions.
- [[Formation Motion]] used for moving groups of characters in a coordinated manner.
