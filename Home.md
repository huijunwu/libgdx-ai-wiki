## What is gdxAI?

It's an artificial intelligence framework, written in Java, for game development with [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).
The framework makes use of a limited number of classes from the libGDX framework (mainly collections which are optimized for mobile platforms) but it does not force you to use that specific framework if you do not wish to do so. However, the libGDX jar remains an essential requirement.

GdxAI tries to be a high-performance framework providing some of the most common AI techniques used by game industry.
However, in the present state of the art, the gdxAI framework covers far less than 10% of the entire game AI area, which is really huge. We've tried to focus on what matters most in game AI development, though. And more stuff will come soon.

## About this wiki

Throughout this wiki, we will cover the entirety of the gdxAI framework, its fundamentals, the theory behind it and how to design intelligent agents.

This is a manual, for a comprehensive API reference, check the [official javadocs](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/gdx-ai/docs/).

## Technical considerations

GdxAI is compatible with Java 6 and [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which means you can also target the browser.

Thanks to its [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/blob/master/LICENSE) license, users have the freedom to use it, modify it and redistribute as they please. Commercial purposes are perfectly allowed.

We're continuously testing and building GdxAI with Jenkins.
