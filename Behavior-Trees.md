# Introduction #

For the last few years, behavior trees (BT) are the major formalism used in game industry to build complex AI behaviors. This success comes from the simplicity to understand, use and develop BT by non programmers. 

Behaviour trees have been proposed as an improvement over Hierarchical State Machines for designing game AI of non-player characters (NPC). Their advantages over traditional AI approaches are being simple to design and implement, scalability when games get larger and more complex, and modularity to aid reusability and portability.

Behaviour trees have been originally adopted for controlling AI behaviors in commercial games such as first-person-shooter Halo2 and life-simulation game Spore.
